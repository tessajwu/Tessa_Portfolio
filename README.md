# About 
<img align="left" src = "images/IMG_9859.jpg" width="320"> 
	Hi! My name is Tessa Wu, a current senior at Boston University majoring in Data Science with a minors in Business Administration and             Mathematics. My coursework, internships, and projects have equipped me with a solid foundation in business, statistics, and computer             science. With a strong understanding of data manipulation, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, I am eager to combine my 		technical expertise with my passion for business and my love for global perspectives to drive forward-thinking data-drvien impacts.
	<br/><br/><br/>
	This Portfolio is a compilation of all of my analytical (data science and business) projects that I have done for academic and self-		learning purposes. It also contains my skills. It is updated on the regular basis.

# Projects

## NBA Celtics Game Predictor
This project aims to provide a better understanding of how predictive analysis is transforming the sports industry, and how teams like the Celtics leverage data to gain a competitive edge and improve their overall performance. Several machine learning models (Logistic Regression, k-NN, Decision Trees, and Random Forest) are implemented to help identify key determinants that could potentially explain the recent success from the Celtics.

## Covid-19 Policy Recomendation
The objective of this project aims to provide policy recommendations for slowing the spread of Covid-19 by analyzong the global policies implemented by 10 representative countries to determine efficacy in keeping down Death and Cases growth rates. The main goal is to implement the most unrestrictive policies to keep the growth rate of deaths below 1% and the growth rate of new cases below 3% on the 30 day average. The ETL pipeline iwas utilized. From extracting the data in a Cosmos DB and Azure SQL to creating a normalized operational (ODS) data store in order to transform the data , and finally loading them into Azure Synapse Analytics. The final data visualization was presented throguh PowerBI.

## Mutual Connections in Social Network
This project utliizes six degrees of freedom to analyze the correlation between the level of connection between individuals within the LinkedIn network and the number of mutual connections. It is often hypothesized that having a pair of first connections would inherently procduce more mutal connections as opposed to two people are are thrid connections with each other. This algorithm is written in Rust supplemented by data visualizations coded in Python.
