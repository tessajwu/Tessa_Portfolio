# Projects

| Project Title | Brief Overview |
| --- | --- |
| [Hate Speech Classifcation](https://github.com/tessajwu/Hate-Speech-Classification) | This project aims to develop a robust speech classification system that incorporates sentiment analysis and topic classification capable of identifying hate speech and/or offensive language within textual data.This multifaceted approach seeks to not only pinpoint instances of negativity but also to understand the contextual nuances and potential societal implications, thereby contributing to the creation of safer and more informed online space. <br><br> **Skills:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, Deep Learning <br> **Tools:** Python| 
| [Investment for Climate Change](https://github.com/tessajwu/Investment_for_Climate_Change) | A participation in a Datathon hosted by Women In Data, this projects examines data in the Climate Risk Viewer to assess climate change vulnerabilities, focusing on projects on climate services and early warning systems, with the goal of identifying investments opportunities and gaps to strength climate resilience. <br><br> **Skills:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), Feature Engineering, Machine Learning <br> **Tools:** Python, Tableau, Canva|
| [NBA Celtics Game Predictor](https://github.com/tessajwu/NBA_Celtics_PredictiveAnalysis) | This projects capitalizes on the rise of sports analytics by focusing on the NBA Celtics game data from the 2018-2019 season to the 2021-2022 season to help identify key determinants that could potentially explain their recent success. <br><br> **Skills:** Business Analytics, Machine Learning, Data Visualization <br> **Tools:** Python, Canva|
| [COVID-19 Policy Recomendation](https://github.com/tessajwu/Covid-19_Policy_Reccomendation) | This project explores data of COVID-19 across 10 different countries from January 2020 - March 2021, analyzing the global policies implemented by 10 representative countries to determine efficacy in keeping down Death and Cases growth rates of COVID-19, and recommends the three most effective policies at decreasing COVID-19 rates. <br><br> **Skills:** Cloud Computing, Data Engineering, Data Visualization <br> **Tools:** Microsoft Azure, SQL, Power BI  |
| [SAT Scores: Intelligence of Income?](https://github.com/tessajwu/Hate-Speech-Classification) | This project aims to provide some insight into how and why family income, rather than raw intelligence, may be the better predictor of SAT scores, and conversely, how SAT scores may be a better predictor of a studentâ€™s family income rather than intelligence.  <br><br> **Skills:** Statistical Analysis  <br> **Tools:** R, Netlify, GitHub| 
| [Mutual Connections in Social Network](https://github.com/tessajwu/Mutual_Connection_in_Social_Network) | This project is a social network analysis that aims to analyze whether mutual connections correlate with the level of connections within a LinkedIn network. <br><br> **Skills:** Six Degrees of Freedom, Breadth First Search (BFS) <br> **Tools:** Rust, Python |
| Loan Default Analysis | (*project still in progress*) |
