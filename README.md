## Projects
[NBA Celtics Game Predictor](https://github.com/tessajwu/Tessa_Portfolio/blob/main/BA305FinalProject.ipynb)
> This project aims to provide a better understanding of how predictive analysis is transforming the sports industry, and how teams like the Celtics leverage data to gain a competitive edge and improve their overall performance. Several machine learning models (Logistic Regression, k-NN, Decision Trees, and Random Forest) are implemented to help identify key determinants that could potentially explain the recent success from the Celtics.
