# Projects
## Investments for Climate Change
Objective: 

## NBA Celtics Game Predictor

This project aims to provide a better understanding of how predictive analysis is transforming the sports industry, and how teams like the Celtics leverage data to gain a competitive edge and improve their overall performance. Several machine learning models (Logistic Regression, k-NN, Decision Trees, and Random Forest) are implemented to help identify key determinants that could potentially explain the recent success from the Celtics.

## Covid-19 Policy Recomendation

**Overview:** This projects explores data of COVID-19 across 10 different countries from January 2020 - March 2021, analyzing the global policies implemented by 10 representative countries to determine efficacy in keeping down Death and Cases growth rates of COVID-19, and recommends the three most effective policies at decreasing COVID-19 rates.

**Skills:** Cloud Computing, Data Engineering, Data Visualization

**Tools:** Microsoft Azure, SQL, Power BI

## Mutual Connections in Social Network
This project utliizes six degrees of freedom to analyze the correlation between the level of connection between individuals within the LinkedIn network and the number of mutual connections. It is often hypothesized that having a pair of first connections would inherently procduce more mutal connections as opposed to two people are are thrid connections with each other. This algorithm is written in Rust supplemented by data visualizations coded in Python.
