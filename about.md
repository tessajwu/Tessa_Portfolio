## About Me

Hi! My name is Tessa Wu, a current Solutions Engineer at Celonis. In simple terms, I work with clients to analyze their business processes using process mining and identify inefficiencies that impact metrics such as cost savings, revenue generation, and overall process efficiency. From there, I help design solutions using applications, automations, and AI to improve their performance.

I have a B.S in Data Science with a minors in Business Administration and Mathematics from Boston University. My professional experience, coursework, and projects have equipped me with a solid foundation in business, statistics, and computer science. With a strong understanding of data manipulation, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, I am eager to combine my technical expertise with my passion for business and my love for global perspectives to drive forward-thinking data-drvien impacts.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I enjoy traveling and listening to music. Traveling for me is not just a hobby but a source of continuous learning and a way to gain a deeper appreciation for the world. I find a lot of joy in exploring new places and connecting with diverse cultures. This passion for diverse perspectives ultimately extends seamlessly into my professional experience in America, Europe, and Asia, providing me with unique insights into diverse business environments. Music serves as my second form of expression. I enjoy taking myself on walks with music which serves as my time to reflect. It’s something so simple yet incredibly gratifying for me to recharge. These activities keep me grounded and focused both in my personal and professional life. 

## Technical Proficiency
My journey in data science has given me a strong foundation in technical skills and data-driven decision-making. I have hone my programming abilities in languages like Python, Java, and R, and am proficient in data visualization tools such as PowerBI and Tableau. I also have hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building predictive models.

## Future Aspirations
As I near the end of my undergraduate journey, I am excited to leverage my data science background and skills to make a positive impact in the world. I envision myself in a forward-thinking organization that values both innovation and a global mindset. I believe that leveraging data in a global context can create profound impacts, and I’m eager to be a part of that.
Personal Interest and Hobbies
Outside of data science and business, I enjoy traveling, music, sports, and photography! I am constantly in the mindset of growth and inpiration. I love to explore new places and learn about different cultures.
